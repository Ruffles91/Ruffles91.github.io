## Project Charter
### Gisborne Special website/ Calendar
#### Problem Statement		
The current website known as gisbornespecials.co.nz just doesn’t suit Gisborne’s needs. The website itself feels extremely outdated and requires a revamp. Lacks content. Needs catchers, which this website makes you want to close it as soon as you open it. Most importantly the UX and UI is not aesthetically unpleasing.	

#### Business Case & Benefits
This website revamp is extremely important 
as modern-day society is moving into 
advanced, pleasing UX and UI. In terms of 
business this will please more customers and 
suit their needs resulting in an increase for
Finance.

#### Project vision		
Our project is to connect the community through not only the physical world but via the internet world as well. This can be provided by implementing a website-based software that gives our Gisborne community access to specials such as Clothing stores, Electronic stores and Events like Odeon Cinema specials, Rugby events, Soccer events and more.
